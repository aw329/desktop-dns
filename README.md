# Desktop DNS

---

Desktop DNS is a toolkit for pre- and post-processing Direct Numerical Simulations of turbomachinery flows. Starting with a blade profile, the toolkit enables users to mesh, simulate and analyze the blade.  

It is intended for aerodynamicists who are familiar with CFD but not necessarily DNS.

The toolkit also includes a public release of *3DNS-gpu* for running simulations.

The *3DNS-gpu* solver is found under Releases.

Some experience of turbomachinery aerodynamics is recommended.

Please follow the guidance in the Jupyter Notebooks and userguide (under docs/).

There are 4 notebooks and these use a range of Python routines that can be found in the  meshing/ and postpro/ directories.

1. Meshing and initial 2D simulation

2. 3D simulation, inlet turbulence, statistical convergence

3. Mesh sensitivity, statistics gathering, entropy budget analysis

4. RANS modelling
