# Desktop DNS

---

Desktop DNS is a toolkit for pre- and post-processing Direct Numerical Simulations of turbomachinery flows.

It is intended for aerodynamicists who are familiar with CFD but not necessarily DNS.

The toolkit also includes a public release of *3DNS-gpu* for running simulations.

The *3DNS-gpu* solver is found under Releases.

Some experience of turbomachinery aerodynamics is recommended.

Please follow the guidance in the Jupyter Notebooks and userguide (under docs/).

There are 4 notebooks and these use a range of Python routines that can be found in the  meshing/ and postpro/ directories.

Some experience of turbomachinery aerodynamics is required.
